												<h3>Welcome to the Hitchhiker's Guide to Choosing Darkmode</h3>
												<p>When you're looking at print media, you don't have a lot of choice as to your light level. In printing, it's quite possible to print black on white, but all but impossible to print white on black - anything that appears as such is most likely a colossal waste of ink. As such, it's only natural that when you read a book you will generally get dark text on a light background. Because computers have long leaned into the metaphor of being a digitized version of a literal desktop, meanwhile, this stylistic element is generally duplicated as the default, even though computer screens start from a black base and then emit light to reach white. Does that really make sense, though?</p>
												<p>Simply put, no. Not in the least bit. The metaphor is increasingly irrelevant in an age where fewer and fewer people have more experience writing on paper than on a keyboard, and there are serious consequences to the light levels involved that we're realizing more and more every day. Your eyes and your brain are put through massive amounts of excess work by every white background page you look at, with impacts on both your general comfort and the quality of your sleep. The ideal webpage is like this picture of an apple. It's mostly dark, but with light spots where necessary, to protect your health. So, before you move on to the other pages to learn more about how your bright screen is hurting you, go up to the top left and click 'Light Like the Sun, Dark Like My Soul' once to drop into darkmode, the feature you probably didn't know you probably wished all websites and applications had.</p>

									<h2>Personal Philosophy</h2>
									<p>Every ton of carbon we release into the atmosphere and every kilogram of metal we refine then dump into a landfill during our lifetimes represents something taken from the future for our own benefit. We, as those currently alive, have an affirmative duty to those who come after us to restrain these takings to only that which is to sustainable, and to give back as much as we take in whatever way achievable. Doing otherwise is akin to mortgaging our collective future as a species with no repayment plan, in the name of immediate gratification and expedience.</p>
