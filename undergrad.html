											<h2>My Undergraduate Studies</h2>
											<h3>A roadmap to this point in my life</h3>
										</header>
										<p>At first, when I went in to higher education, I didn't have much of a clue what I wanted to do with my life at all. Originallly, 'urban planning for sustainability' was something I said to an advisor at Tacoma Community College because in the moment of being asked what I wanted to work towards, it came to mind as a tentative answer. As a result of that vague commitment, while I was working towards my AA to transfer to the University of Washington Tacoma campus, I proactively pursued the Sustainability Distinction Pathway offered at TCC. By the time I graduated, though, immersing myself in the field and even joining the local Environmental Club had gotten me fully onboard with what my mouth had signed me up for.</p>
										<p>As a result of all of that, I applied for the Sustainable Urban Development (SUD) program at the University of Washington Tacoma campus. It was a good two-and-one-third years working towards my Bachelor's Degree - I was able to meet all sorts of interesting, intelligent people and get exposure to a wide range of ideas. If I had been onboard for my plans before, now I was downright enthusiastic for them. Around the halfway point, though, a former professor of mine reached out with some good advice - if I wanted to go into a planning Master's program, I should attempt the Certificate in Geographic Information Systems to increase my qualifications, to better compete with applicants whose undergraduate educations were more planning focused.</p>
										<p>That wasn't something I had really considered before. I had taken a mandatory course in GIS as part of the SUD program by that point, but between a bad experience with GIS at TCC and the fact that the GIS courses were as late in the evening as courses at UWT ever got, I wasn't sure before then I wanted to. Nevertheless, I took the suggestion, applied to the Certificate, and completed it as a minor during my second year on campus.</p>
										<p>At the same time as I was completing the most intense part of my SUD coursework, I took my studies of GIS to the next level in the Certificate program. At the same time, even though I'd entered without any intention to pursue a career in GIS, the whole field grew on me. By the time I graduated Magna Cum Laude in fall of my third year, I'd come to a conclusion that would have seemed baffling to me back in my TCC days - while I really, truly wanted to work towards urban sustainability, I wanted to do it as a GIS practitioner, not a planner. In large part, this change of heart comes down to my experiences in completing my project for the certificate.</p>
										<p>In this project, documents related to which are available on the right sidebar of the page, I examined demographic data in relation to EPA toxic release data in Tacoma to identify signs of environmental racism at the level of blockgroups, schools, and parks. In retrospect, it was a fairly simple project, and utterly defined by the limits and options in the proprietary tools we used in the program, but it still holds a warm place in my heart, and guides my plans for the future to some extent.</p>

									<h2>Personal Philosophy</h2>
									<p>Every ton of carbon we release into the atmosphere and every kilogram of metal we refine then dump into a landfill during our lifetimes represents something taken from the future for our own benefit. We, as those currently alive, have an affirmative duty to those who come after us to restrain these takings to only that which is to sustainable, and to give back as much as we take in whatever way achievable. Doing otherwise is akin to mortgaging our collective future as a species with no repayment plan, in the name of immediate gratification and expedience.</p>
