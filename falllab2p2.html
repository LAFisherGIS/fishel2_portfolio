											    <div class="pagecontent">
									          <p>From the ASARCO smelter of Ruston to the industries of the port, the Tacoma area is far from free of toxic traces of its past and present. These toxins, frequently lingering underground, are not all a constant and active danger - indeed, some are in the process of being cleaned up even now - but the risk does exist in every case that under the right weather or disaster conditions people in the area could become exposed to these hidden hazards. As such, it is important to keep in mind the areas in which these toxins exist, for the sake of identifying the different risks faced by people in different parts of the city. For the purposes of risk evaluation and comparison, the schools and city council districts of Tacoma have been plotted to contextualize the threat these contaminated sites pose.</p>
									          <div id="map"></div>
									          <div id="Informational">
									            <h3>About the Analysis</h3>
									            <p>For the purposes of identifying the risk faced by particular areas of the city and the schools within, a 200 meter buffer has been calculated from the location of each contaminated site, representing a perhaps conservative estimate of the area in which someone out on normal day to day business might pass close enough to the site to be exposed to toxins in the event that the toxins are released into the streets. Where it overlaps with the grounds of a school, the students, faculty, staff, and if applicable PTA are considered to be at risk. Schools outside of the council districts of Tacoma have been included only when they are stated internally in the data in use to be part of Tacoma. In recognition of the fact that regulars of facilities other than schools are in no less risk than those present in schools, the city council districts of Tacoma have likewise been classified on the basis of the portion of their landmass which falls within these areas. Contaminated sites have been included regardless of their locations within Pierce County, so long as the level of risk they present has been evaluated and listed in the data, because even a toxic site outside of Tacoma proper can still threaten Tacomans. For more precise information on whether you are potentially at risk, zoom in to check by street names if you spend a large portion of your time in a contaminated site's risk zone. The points representing schools are clickable and will yield information on the name, street address, and type (IE, elementary, middle, high, private, technical, university) of the school in question.</p>

									<h2>Personal Philosophy</h2>
									<p>Every ton of carbon we release into the atmosphere and every kilogram of metal we refine then dump into a landfill during our lifetimes represents something taken from the future for our own benefit. We, as those currently alive, have an affirmative duty to those who come after us to restrain these takings to only that which is to sustainable, and to give back as much as we take in whatever way achievable. Doing otherwise is akin to mortgaging our collective future as a species with no repayment plan, in the name of immediate gratification and expedience.</p>
