												<h3>Eye Strain: What is it, and why do you want to avoid it?</h3>
												<p>Computer overuse can be a major cause for eye strain - that nasty sensation when your eyes are badly overworked and they start to hurt and lose focus. While the brightness of your screen certainly isn't the only reason for this, it's quite notable among them. As <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/eye_strain/article.htm">Medicinenet</a> notes, one of the causes of the sensation is the very act of viewing something too bright, which can give partial context as to why they also note looking at screens as a major cause of the unpleasant annoyance. Of course, you should make sure to blink enough, but your screen itself has some blame in this.</p>
												<p>Every new website will generally, barring you making adjustments to your browser's display rules themselves, barrage you with a dark-on-light scheme. That's a major source of added light, which is extra work for your eyes. Hence, more eyestrain. It's a far cry from the distant past, when computers were simpler, more terminal based affairs, and dark-on-light was the default for monitor displays. When you pick darkmode, though, options permitting, you can escape from that!</p>

									<h2>Personal Philosophy</h2>
									<p>The people who live now have no business in mortgaging the future to temporarily enrich the present. This makes it even more egregious that the future is, indeed, presently being mortgaged away for the sake of enriching an ultra-minority of those who currently live. Even if everyone currently living benefited equally from our present unsustainability, it would be indefensible to willfully perpetuate the unsustainability beyond what is presently unavoidable. As it stands, only a very small group stands to benefit even temporarily from slowing the push towards a greener economy. As such, we should consider why it is that their voices are so much louder than everyone else's that we're still on that course.</p>
