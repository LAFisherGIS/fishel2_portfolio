											<h2>Capstone Plans</h2>
											<h3>Environmental Racism and its Material Effects in Tacoma Washington</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Though the project is still in a very early stage of planning, too early to release any real materials on it, it is possible even at this early phase for me to explain in general what the purpose is. In the simplest terms, building on the endpoint of my prior project, my capstone is intended to go beyond simply looking for signs of environmental racism and seek to establish statistical correlations between the presence of pollution in an environment and two characteristics of the areas shrouded in this pollution - the academic performance of schools attended by local students, and the level of sickness present in the area. In this sense, the statistical significance or lack thereof of pollution as a structural factor in determining people's life outcomes will be evaluated, providing some real sense of the actual felt consequences of this pollution and the level of urgency with which it should be remedied.</p>

									<h2>Personal Philosophy</h2>
									<p>The people who live now have no business in mortgaging the future to temporarily enrich the present. This makes it even more egregious that the future is, indeed, presently being mortgaged away for the sake of enriching an ultra-minority of those who currently live. Even if everyone currently living benefited equally from our present unsustainability, it would be indefensible to willfully perpetuate the unsustainability beyond what is presently unavoidable. As it stands, only a very small group stands to benefit even temporarily from slowing the push towards a greener economy. As such, we should consider why it is that their voices are so much louder than everyone else's that we're still on that course.</p>
