											<h2>Capstone Progress</h2>
											<h3>Environmental Racism and its Material Effects on Education in Tacoma Washington - Preliminary Outputs</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Although not yet complete, considerable progress has been made in the planned investigation of the potential for a link between disparities in air pollution exposure in Tacoma and disparities in achieved standardized test scores across space. A model describing the predicted air pollution density in various parts of the city has been constructed based on gathered air pollution readings (though the sample of  places and times is by no means robust enough to stand serious interrogation) and publicly available data using XLUR, and based on this model regressions both geographically weighted and not have been applied to investigate the potential for explanatory power.

										Initial results are interesting but seem 'too good to be true' - there is a need to investigate further and refine the methodology to identify just how accurate they could be or not be. Pursuant to this, a preliminary release has been prepared to gather feedback.</p>

											<h2>Initial Pollution Model - Block Groups</h2>
											<p>Although this model provides results that were probably much more accurate over the port of Tacoma, predicted values were far too distinct from measured values in many more populated areas, and a sizable number of the points used to generate it were from an area of active road work which could not be assumed to be representative of normal conditions in the area.</p>

											<h2>Modified Pollution Model - Block Groups</h2>
											<p>By dropping the points found near the University of the Puget Sound campus, which were largely tied up in active road work, it is believed that pollution results shown have been made more accurate. However, notable issues with the collection method remain, some areas seem to host possible underestimates, and the most northeastern parts of Tacoma were never tested at all.</p>

											<h3>Tacoma Public School Grades</h3>
										</header>
										<p>The grades under analysis are 2014 and 2015 Adequate Yearly Progress metrics for Tacoma Public Schools elementary and middle schools, attached to school catchment area polygons provided by Dr. Matthew Kelley of the University of Washington Tacoma campus. These grades for reading and math run from -100, the worst standardized testing performance, to 0, representing the best standardized testing performance. Note for future reference that most high grades are found in areas of comparatively lower pollution, as well as that there are fewer middle school regions, and in these regions pollution and educational outcomes may seem less connected than with elementary schools.</p>

											<h3>Correlations</h3>
										</header>
										<p>As noted prior, two types of statistical regression have been used to interrogate the possible relationship between air pollution predictions and observed educational outcomes - a bisquare geographically weighted regression and a 'global' least squares base spatial regression. The former of these has the benefit of allowing variations in the apparent importance of the variables in question to be investigated visually, while the latter is more suited to actual investigation of the apparent strength of the effect. Though other variables have been tried, at the present time the only two represented in the regressions are predicted pollution and the average median income of the block groups of residence of each predicted student (children in roughly the correct age range, as attested by American Community Survey data), as including too many variables was found to exaggerate the apparent impact of pollution and mask the significance of income, along with creating other considerable problems.
										</p>
										<p>Below, the GWR R^2 value (percentage of variation explained by the variables at hand, written as a decimal rather than percentage) maps for each level-year-topic combination will be displayed in combination with relevant details from the OLS regressions - the intercepts (predicted base values), the coefficients and p-values for pollution and median income (in US dollars), and the adjusted r^2 (percent of variation explained) of each 'global' regression.

											<h3>Revisions</h3>
										</header>
										<p>After this initial analysis was carried out, an alternative method of characterizing socioeconomic status was implemented based partly on Mullen, Grineski, Collins, and Mendoza (2020)'s concept for a 'school disadvantage index' based on socioeconomic and. Data characterizing the per-school status regarding Title I supplemental funding eligibility, free and reduced lunch eligibility proportions of students, student body population, and numbers of Latinx, Native American, Pacific Islander, and Black students (the authors of the above referenced paper included Asian students with pacific islanders, and did not consider Latinx students) were downloaded from the National Center for Education Statistics for 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 and, aside from the categorical title I eligibility data, processed into five classes through Jenks Natural Breaks (the authors did not discuss the method they used to weight their index, so one had to be developed quickly for this project). These data were then used to produce three distinct model attempts - Index A, which weighted each variable equally as worth between one and five points, Index B, which weighted title I eligibility as worth five points (ineligibility counting for zero points) and free/reduced lunch statistics as worth one to five, but ethnic statistics as worth zero point six to three, and Index C, which did the opposite, rating ethnic characteristics as more important. Ethnic data are included in the analysis for the sake of approximating intergenerational wealth disparities and other systemic disadvantages, and in no way as a means to make judgements on particular cultures.
										</p>
										<p>Generally, the index with the strongest perfomance was A, while C generally had the weakest performance, when the p-value is considered. Though cases did exist where B was stronger than A, or where C was stronger than both, or where no difference could be discerned within the level of precision provided, A was generally strongest and also had the lowest multicollinearity condition number in most cases. As such, only Index A will be considered here. The theoretical minimum value of the index was five, with a theoretical maximum of thirty.</p>

											<h3>Discussion</h3>
										</header>
										<p>These results are strictly provisional, as the design of this project is centered not around making any authoritative statement on the matter, but rather investigating the potential need for a more rigorous study on the matter. Possible causes for 2014 and 2015 educational outcomes have here been investigated using 2014-2015 American Community Survey data and block groups, aggregated using 2016-2017 school catchment areas, and an air pollution model developed based on a survey of a limited sample of Tacoma's streets at different times, on different days, in different months of 2022, using the hazard estimates produced by an off the shelf Plume Labs Flow2 air pollution monitor and data available through the City of Tacoma and Pierce County geospatial data portals. In a full study on the matter, socioeconomic and demographic data would ideally be collected at the school level or an even finer resolution through collaboration with Tacoma Public Schools and community organizations, and a network of air pollution monitors would be dispersed throughout Tacoma to run continuously and concurrently for a prolonged period to generate a robust dataset for various times of day. However, the results produced do seem to point to it being worth such a more rigorous investigation.</p>
										<p>At the elementary school level, results conform more or less to what would be expected if air pollution in Tacoma had a substantial impact on experienced variation in academic outcomes - out of the 100 point scale of the AYP data, approximately 10-30 points seem accounted for by pollution variation depending on year and subject, which seems to be negatively correlated with good grades, if taken at face value. At the onset of the project, a pollution p-value of between 0.1 and 0.3 was estimated to roughly indicate a high enough chance of pollution having a real correlation with outcomes that a further study would, without a doubt, be worth conducting, while one below 0.1 was identified as a possible sign of unconsidered variables influencing the results. As it stands, Index A produces a mix of scores within the 'goldilocks zone', below that range, and slightly above it at the elementary school level. This is tentatively accepted as evidence that it may be worth a further analysis on the topic, though it would not be enough to reject the null hypothesis that pollution is not a meaningful influencer of grades in Tacoma.</p>
										<p>However, at the middle school level results differ wildly from expectations and from the threshold for furhter consideration. Not once does the p-value drop below 0.3 at this level. Furthermore, pollution is not negatively but rather positively correlated with academic outcomes. This lack of certainty and counterintuitive outcome raises questions about what might be happening to create such results at the middle school level. Do any effects of pollution fall off by middle school? Is there some unseen variable prejudicing the elementary school or middle school results? Does the different scale of the school polygons distort the results? Does the smaller number of middle schools in Tacoma Public Schools explain the discrepancy in part? Or are there alternative schools one might move onto at the middle school level that would explain the discrepancy? Although they don't seem to indicate a likelihood of pollution reducing grades, these wildly differing results still seem to call for a deeper investigation simply to explain why they are so different from those at the elementary school level.</p>
										<p>It could be the case that attempting to model a relationship between air pollution and academic performance as a linear equation is simply doomed to fail - that the impact of the pollution increases or decreases at certain critical thresholds. Alternatively, Mullen, Grineski, Collins, and Mendoza (2020) found evidence in their research that poorer schools may display less apparent effects from increases in air pollution than wealthier ones, because the perfomance damage is already being caused through other parts of the lived experience, which may have some explanatory power here. More investigation is needed to properly identify the cause of these discrepancies and what level of actual explanatory power pollution might possess.</p>
										<p>Originally, individual demographic categories of students were also investigated using a combination of census data and published metrics in the educational outcome data analyzed, and the data relating to these analyses have been retained, but it was found from the results that the methods used to estimate the average conditions of students of specific ethnic groups based on the American Community Survey data does not produce  results which would be considered statistically significant. This is likely due to the facts that blockgroups are comparatively large, heterogeneous units, that the number of children of a given ethnic group was simply being estimated, and the fact that ascribing the mean or median condition across a whole block group to members of a particular subset of it is a logical and statistical fallacy, meaning that the data being used in an attempt to explain educational outcomes were not accurate to the student populations in question in the first place. Additionally, not all schools had data for all student ethnicities, but this may not have been adequately addressed in the code written. As such, analysis at the level of individual demographics or comparison within schools was abandoned well before the implementation of the disadvantage index.

									<h2>Personal Philosophy</h2>
									<p>Every ton of carbon we release into the atmosphere and every kilogram of metal we refine then dump into a landfill during our lifetimes represents something taken from the future for our own benefit. We, as those currently alive, have an affirmative duty to those who come after us to restrain these takings to only that which is to sustainable, and to give back as much as we take in whatever way achievable. Doing otherwise is akin to mortgaging our collective future as a species with no repayment plan, in the name of immediate gratification and expedience.</p>
