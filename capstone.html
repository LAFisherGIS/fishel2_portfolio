											<h2>Capstone Progress</h2>
											<h3>Environmental Racism and its Material Effects on Education in Tacoma Washington - Preliminary Outputs</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Although not yet complete, considerable progress has been made in the planned investigation of the potential for a link between disparities in air pollution exposure in Tacoma and disparities in achieved standardized test scores across space. A model describing the predicted air pollution density in various parts of the city has been constructed based on gathered air pollution readings (though the sample of  places and times is by no means robust enough to stand serious interrogation) and publicly available data using XLUR, and based on this model regressions both geographically weighted and not have been applied to investigate the potential for explanatory power.

										Initial results are interesting but seem 'too good to be true' - there is a need to investigate further and refine the methodology to identify just how accurate they could be or not be. Pursuant to this, a preliminary release has been prepared to gather feedback.</p>

											<h2>Initial Pollution Model - Block Groups</h2>
											<p>Although this model provides results that were probably much more accurate over the port of Tacoma, predicted values were far too distinct from measured values in many more populated areas, and a sizable number of the points used to generate it were from an area of active road work which could not be assumed to be representative of normal conditions in the area.</p>

											<h2>Modified Pollution Model - Block Groups</h2>
											<p>By dropping the points found near the University of the Puget Sound campus, which were largely tied up in active road work, it is believed that pollution results shown have been made more accurate. However, notable issues with the collection method remain, some areas seem to host possible underestimates, and the most northeastern parts of Tacoma were never tested at all.</p>

											<h3>Tacoma Public School Grades</h3>
										</header>
										<p>The grades under analysis are 2014 and 2015 Adequate Yearly Progress metrics for Tacoma Public Schools elementary and middle schools, attached to school catchment area polygons provided by Dr. Matthew Kelley of the University of Washington Tacoma campus. These grades for reading and math run from -100, the worst standardized testing performance, to 0, representing the best standardized testing performance. Note for future reference that most high grades are found in areas of comparatively lower pollution, as well as that there are fewer middle school regions, and in these regions pollution and educational outcomes may seem less connected than with elementary schools.</p>

											<h3>Correlations</h3>
										</header>
										<p>As noted prior, two types of statistical regression have been used to interrogate the possible relationship between air pollution predictions and observed educational outcomes - a bisquare geographically weighted regression and a 'global' least squares base spatial regression. The former of these has the benefit of allowing variations in the apparent importance of the variables in question to be investigated visually, while the latter is more suited to actual investigation of the apparent strength of the effect. Though other variables have been tried, at the present time the only two represented in the regressions are predicted pollution and the average median income of the block groups of residence of each predicted student (children in roughly the correct age range, as attested by American Community Survey data), as including too many variables was found to exaggerate the apparent impact of pollution and mask the significance of income, along with creating other considerable problems.
										</p>
										<p>Below, the GWR R^2 value (percentage of variation explained by the variables at hand, written as a decimal rather than percentage) maps for each level-year-topic combination will be displayed in combination with relevant details from the OLS regressions - the intercepts (predicted base values), the coefficients and p-values for pollution and median income (in US dollars), and the adjusted r^2 (percent of variation explained) of each 'global' regression.

											<h3>Discussion</h3>
										</header>
										<p>The results of these regressions have been highly mixed in a way that suggests a number of flaws in the current approach. For one, the p-values obtained from the majority of the elementary school readings for p-values are far, far lower than could ever reasonably be expected from the methods used. A very basic pollution model prepared in 2022 from an extremely limited pool of observations was used in combination with 2016-2017 school catchment areas to investigate possible causes for educational outcomes measured in 2014-2015. It makes very little sense to get any p-value below 0.1 through these methods - the goal of this project was set on 'suggesting that a more rigorous analysis may be necessary' from the beginning for a reason. Furthermore, the inconsistency across topics, years, and grade levels suggests that some other phenomena which, in many cases, varies alongside the estimated pollution, might be be having its own correlation with grade results falsely included in that of pollution. Whatever actual correlation the estimated pollution might have with grades, it is unlikely to be as strong or certain as the most extreme outcomes shown at the elementary school level. One possible example of such a missing variable would be the portion of the population living below the poverty line.</p>
										<p>Also worth considering is the fact that, in all cases in middle schools, pollution was rated as fairly unlikely to truly have the supposed correlation to grades - and said correlation was a positive correlation. This may be further evidence of flaws in the methodology thus far, though it may also simply be a matter of middle schools covering larger areas and having a narrower range of grades than elementary schools, combined with a different range of pollution values due to the differing block groups included. The smaller number of middle schools could, in its own right, adversely effect the statistical analysis, as well.</p>
										<p>It is also very possible that any relationship that could exist is too complex to be described through a linear equation, and a more nuanced statistical regression which can assess 'critical masses' or breakpoints in the data to see if there are varying levels of apparent effect at varying levels of exposure might be needed. All of these factors must be considered as the project continues, for best results.</p>
										<p>Originally, individual demographic categories of students were also investigated using a combination of census data and published metrics in the educational outcome data analyzed, and the data relating to these analyses have been retained, but it was found from the results that the methods used to estimate the average conditions of students of specific ethnic groups based on the American Community Survey data does not produce  results which would be considered statistically significant. This is likely due to the facts that blockgroups are comparatively large, heterogeneous units, that the number of children of a given ethnic group was simply being estimated, and the fact that ascribing the mean or median condition across a whole block group to members of a particular subset of it is a logical and statistical fallacy, meaning that the data being used in an attempt to explain educational outcomes were not accurate to the student populations in question in the first place. Additionally, not all schools had data for all student ethnicities, but this may not have been adequately addressed in the code written.

									<h2>Personal Philosophy</h2>
									<p>Every ton of carbon we release into the atmosphere and every kilogram of metal we refine then dump into a landfill during our lifetimes represents something taken from the future for our own benefit. We, as those currently alive, have an affirmative duty to those who come after us to restrain these takings to only that which is to sustainable, and to give back as much as we take in whatever way achievable. Doing otherwise is akin to mortgaging our collective future as a species with no repayment plan, in the name of immediate gratification and expedience.</p>
