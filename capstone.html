											<h2>Capstone Project</h2>
											<h3>Air Pollution and Early Learning Outcomes in Tacoma, Washington: Prospects for Future Research on Environmental Rationales for the Achievement Gaps in Tacoma</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Planned in the Fall and Winter, this project was carried out throughout Spring and Summer 2022. The purpose of this project was to apply current scientific thinking on the prediction of air pollution and the effects it can have on developing brains to the case of Tacoma, Washington - a postindustrial, auto-dependent city that depends heavily on the diesel-powered container ships that come into port for its economy.</p>

											<h3>Project Overview</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Air pollution can have a variety of effects on those who inhale it, but perhaps one of the most concerning expressions of this is the effect it can have on young children. If exposed at an early enough age, or through a mother who was herself exposed while pregnant, a child can experience permanent alterations to their brain and wider nervous systems that may permanently degrade their ability to learn and exert self control. A result of this can be the lifelong reduction of academic ability, a key factor in future economic success. These facts make it particularly important to evaluate cities like Tacoma, where a number of factors exist which increase the likelihood and magnitude of air pollution exposure, from an environmental justice perspective, which seeks to identify if particular groups are unevenly exposed to toxins. As such, this project was designed to begin the process of determining if the variability of air pollution exposure throughout Tacoma explains some of the variability in standardized test scores, based on educational scores from 2014 and 2015.</p>
										<p>To this end, air pollution data was collected throughout the city of Tacoma using a portable tracker, and used with a variety of data such as road classifications and known polluting sites to estimate air pollution levels throughout the city. The expected pollution exposure of children at each Tacoma Public Schools elementary was estimated by averaging pollution across every census block group in each school's catchment area - the area where students will, by default, be enrolled in that school - and then using this and the number of appropriately aged children reported by the census to come up with a school-level average for pollution exposure. A rough proxy for the socioeconomic status (SES) - parental wealth, education, income, authority, etc. - of children at the various elementary and middle schools of Tacoma was then generated based on economic and demographic data collected from schools by the federal government. This was necessary because family SES is another known factor in childhood academic performance. With both of those figures generated, it was possible to use statistical methods to estimate the strength of the relationship between pollution, status, and educational performance in math and reading.</p>
										<p>The results reached were mixed. At the elementary school level, results indicated with a higher than expected level of confidence that increased air pollution exposure did seem to substantially reduce academic performance, even if less so than reduced socioeconomic status. At the middle school level, however, the results produced had very low levels of confidence associated with them, and suggested instead that pollution seemed to boost grades - something which is strongly unlikely to be literally true, given current understandings of neurology. These results seem to indicate one of a number of things; that air pollution in Tacoma is more impactful at the elementary school level, that an unconsidered factor may have influenced things at the middle school level to obscure the impacts of pollution, that the data were getting too generalized and averaged out across the scope of a middle school catchment area to identify real trends, or indeed that an unconsidered factor may have created the illusion of notable impacts at the elementary school level. Further research is needed, with community involvement, finer grained data, more advanced statistics, and longer term air pollution sampling, to come to a firm conclusion as to whether pollution levels in areas of Tacoma are enough to notably harm academic performance. Even so, results at the elementary level are strong enough to suggest that such research would more likely than not find a substantial relationship between the levels of air pollution present in parts of the city and reduced grades in those areas, which is enough to justify the effort and resources required to carry such research out.</p>

									<h2>Personal Philosophy</h2>
									<p>Every ton of carbon we release into the atmosphere and every kilogram of metal we refine then dump into a landfill during our lifetimes represents something taken from the future for our own benefit. We, as those currently alive, have an affirmative duty to those who come after us to restrain these takings to only that which is to sustainable, and to give back as much as we take in whatever way achievable. Doing otherwise is akin to mortgaging our collective future as a species with no repayment plan, in the name of immediate gratification and expedience.</p>
