											<h2>About Me</h2>
										</header>
										<p>I was born in fall of 1995 in southern California. However, I don't actually have many if any memories of life down there, because we immediately moved to the Pacific Northwest before I was old enough to form permanent memories. I've lived essentially all of my life northwest of Gig Harbor in Pierce County as the child of a divorced waitress who had to work her hardest year-round to make ends meet. Living in an environment like that, I've had excellent access to forests and minimal access to anything else all this time. Everything, genuinely everything, except for trees is a lengthy drive away in such an environment.</p>
										<p>While it took me awhile to choose my current path as a professional and academic, I would like to think that this background had some part to play in shaping my current focus on matters of equity, social justice, and environmental sustainability. That my goals are a synthesis of a fundamental, lived understanding of the disparities people can face and the broader understanding of the big picture and science involved I've picked up throughout my post-secondary years.</p>
										<p>I'm especially open to working with non-profits and local governments in the long term, but am not currently seeking employment. My pronouns are they/them.</p>

									<h2>Personal Philosophy</h2>
									<p>The people who live now have no business in mortgaging the future to temporarily enrich the present. This makes it even more egregious that the future is, indeed, presently being mortgaged away for the sake of enriching an ultra-minority of those who currently live. Even if everyone currently living benefited equally from our present unsustainability, it would be indefensible to willfully perpetuate the unsustainability beyond what is presently unavoidable. As it stands, only a very small group stands to benefit even temporarily from slowing the push towards a greener economy. As such, we should consider why it is that their voices are so much louder than everyone else's that we're still on that course.</p>
