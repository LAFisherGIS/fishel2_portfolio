											<h2>About Liam Fisher</h2>
										</header>
										<p>I'm a lifelong resident of the Pacific Northwest in my mid 20s. From 2018 through the present I've been a student at the University of Washington Tacoma campus. My undergraduate major, which I completed magna cum laude, was sustainable urban development, with a certificate in GIS as my minor. Currently, I am enrolled in the Master of Science in Geospatial Technologies program, and aiming to earn my degree in Summer of 2022.</p>
										<p>I have no formal work experience. However, owing to my academic and personal background, I have a particular interest in work that emphasizes social justice and environmental sustainability, especially if it involves working with non-profits and local governments. This is the general area in which my self-guided coursework has been focused since my time at Tacoma Community College earning my associate's degree, and when I earn my master's degree, it will have been through a project emphasizing similar themes. It is, as much as I can be said to have one at this early juncture in my career, my area of specialization as an urban scholar and spatial analyst.</p>
										<p>I am not currently seeking employment, owing to the difficulty of balancing graduate coursework with a work schedule, particularly in the exceptionally difficult times we've all spent the last two years navigating. However, soon after graduation in the summer I expect to begin seeking employment. I am uncertain whether I will begin pursuing a doctorate in the forseeable future. In the event that I do, however, it will only be after accumulating a number of years of work experience to build upon throughout that pursuit. My pronouns are they/them.</p>
										<p>Formal resumes and CVs available on request only. Offering a general release resume at this time would be premature, given the intensive pace at which I will have to acquire new skills as part of the Master of Science in Geospatial Technologies program. One may be linked on this page nearer to the conclusion of the program, however.</p>

									<h2>Personal Philosophy</h2>
									<p>Every ton of carbon we release into the atmosphere and every kilogram of metal we refine then dump into a landfill during our lifetimes represents something taken from the future for our own benefit. We, as those currently alive, have an affirmative duty to those who come after us to restrain these takings to only that which is to sustainable, and to give back as much as we take in whatever way achievable. Doing otherwise is akin to mortgaging our collective future as a species with no repayment plan, in the name of immediate gratification and expedience.</p>
