												<h3>Your Circadian Rhythm: How It Works and Why You Want it Working</h3>
												<p>The circadian rhythm - literally, translated from Latin, the 'roughly a day' rhythm. That's the term for every 24 hour cycle in your body, including <a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/circadian-rhythm/sleep-drive-and-your-body-clock"  target="_null">how your brain regulates your sleep cycle</a> Bright lights, especially ones with short wavelengths like blue and purple - which are present in white light, like that of the sun - suppress the release of a hormone called melatonin, and the accumulation of this melatonin over the course of the day - your brain aims for 24 hours or thereabouts - is what instructs your brain to make you feel sleepy and, eventually, to go to sleep. Before artificial light became cheap as free, this cycle meant that we didn't start secreting melatonin until the sun started to go down, which in combination with our brain's internal timekeeping meant that we were mostly awake when it was light out and mostly asleep when it was dark out - going to sleep roughly the same time every night, unless seasonal variations adjusted the time of sundown. <a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/circadian-rhythm">Circadian rhythms also have massive implications for the rest of your health.</a></p>
												<p>If you're a habitual computer user, you probably spend a lot of time looking at a screen after sundown. That's a problem, if you're not using darkmode - you're staring straight at a wall of bright white light, shutting off your melatonin production and throwing your sleep cycle out of whack. You'd still be getting some white light on darkmode, but a lot less. So especially late in the day, you should make sure to use darkmode. For extra assurance, you might also want to use a blue light filtering application such as those available for smartphones, desktops and laptops, and even built into the base settings of Windows 10. With that sort of thing, you can set your screen to automatically remove short-wavelength light to some extent at a given time, making your screen more amber-red and reducing its impact on your sleep cycle - it'll look weird for awhile, but once you get used to it you won't even notice the difference. Sorry, by the way, but the creator of this circadian rhythm diagram had no sense of irony - the background for it is white!</p>

									<h2>Personal Philosophy</h2>
									<p>The people who live now have no business in mortgaging the future to temporarily enrich the present. This makes it even more egregious that the future is, indeed, presently being mortgaged away for the sake of enriching an ultra-minority of those who currently live. Even if everyone currently living benefited equally from our present unsustainability, it would be indefensible to willfully perpetuate the unsustainability beyond what is presently unavoidable. As it stands, only a very small group stands to benefit even temporarily from slowing the push towards a greener economy. As such, we should consider why it is that their voices are so much louder than everyone else's that we're still on that course.</p>
